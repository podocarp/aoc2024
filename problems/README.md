Problem statements, inputs, and solutions reside here under each folder.
Folders are by day.
Each folder contains `input`, and `sol.c`, and a `day*.txt` which contains the
question statement.

The makefile only compiles `problems/*/sol.c`, so you can copy `problems/sol.c`
to use as a starting point.
